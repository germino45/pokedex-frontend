# Pokedex Frontend Build

### Overview

- Intro
- Github Pages link
- Improves & future features

**Intro**

- This project utilizes React.js and Vite. I chose to work with PokeApi in order to display various Pokemon. Users can search Pokemon either by name or number in the searchbar. If a card is clicked, users can see a picture of the selected Pokemon, their type(s) and their weight. Users can also visit the About page to learn why I chose to work on this project. If a user enters an invalid url, they will be greeted by a Psyduck telling them that the page they are trying to visit is not found and will redirect them back to the home page.

**Improves & future features**

- I will be working on a responsive design to work with vertical monitors and phones. There will also be a feature where users can log in and like Pokemon, which will be added into their profile. Finally, sprite sounds will be played when a user clicks on a card. This will all come in the next update
